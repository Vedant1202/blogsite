        <p>Music gives a soul to the universe,wings to the mind, flight to the imagination and life to everything.” Vidyalankar Polytechnic initiated an attempt in the form of ‘SwaralankarSolo
            Light Music Competition’, to foster and value music both as part of a universal education, and as an essential expression of the human experience and spirit. <br>
      The event witnessed a warm response on 11 February 2019 by proudly hosting more than 100 singers from all over Maharashtra. To embellish
the musical experience in a significant way, VP invited ace judges of the music fraternity. The Chief Guests Shri
AnandBhate and Shri Kaushal Inamdar also enjoy a substantial stature in the field of classical music. <br> 
The winner was awarded with Rs.10000/- along with 2 Days 1 Night stay at Mahabaleshwar sponsored by Anandvan Bhuvan.
In today’s scenario, many educational institutes are engrossed in grade based learning, promoting mechanical education. This activity
organised and accomplished by VP is a remarkable step that fosters opportunities for cultural and aesthetic experiences of participants through
active participation in music, and helps to enhance their persona.</p>

        <h2 class="post-title">The Ripple Effect: NSS-VIT making a difference! </h2>
        <p>The National Service Scheme (NSS) is a community service program involving youth on a very large
scale to participate in community service. The sole aim of the NSS is to provide hands-on experience to
young students in delivering community service without any bias. <br>
        The students of Vidyalankar Institute of Technology led by the Program Officer Prof. Pravin Gharge and a team of
dedicated teachers have successfully revived NSS in the campus and are emerging as a strong unit for community service.
The NSS-VIT unit provided a helping hand for the ‘Kerala Flood Victims’ by organizing a donation drive on campus
and transporting around 30-35 cartons of flood relief material to the flood
affected areas in Kerala. <br>
        After Ganesh Visarjan, the NSS-VIT volunteers put in coordinated efforts to cleanup the Dadar Chowpatty beach by sorting
out plastic and other non-biodegradable waste. This idea of beach clean-up is the smallest act of kindness that is
worth more than the grandest intention. <br>
        
        The NSS volunteers at Vidyalankar Institute of Technology believe in the philosophy that “I am only one, but I am one. I cannot
do everything but I can do something. And I will not let what I cannot do interfere with what I can do”. Happiest
are the NSS volunteers at VIT who lose themselves in the service of the others!</p>
